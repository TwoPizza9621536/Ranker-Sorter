        If you can rate/rank chess players by using Elo, then why not
        characters.

      <p>
        This is yet another ranker that I created using the Elo Rating System,
        famous in the world of chess to rate the skills of players as a zero-sum
        game. But this rating system has also been used in other applications
        like

          rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow external" target="_blank">
          dating apps and love</a>.
        If love is a zero-sum game than why not the interest or attention of
        a character or thing that are comparable (or anything that is zero-sum
        game).
      </p>
      <p>
        To assume that the interest of a character is a zero-sum game, we need
        to measure interest based on how much attention they get, and that
        attention is limited. Which means attention for a character is neither
        gain nor removed, but only taken away or from other characters to have
        an interest for that character. In other words when a person shows an
        interest for new character, their interest is lessen for a preexisting
        established character.

            What is the Elo Rating System?
          </summary>
          <p>
            The Elo rating system is a method for calculating the relative skill
            levels of players in zero-sum games such as chess. It is named after
            its creator Arpad Elo, a Hungarian-American physics professor.

            Are the results accurate and should I take those results seriously?
          </summary>
          <p>
            Slightly yes with a grain of salt. Elo is mainly based on statistics
            and probability. A rating is just a number just label the
            probability of liking a character. Probability is just a number that
            tells how likely a character is being your most favorite which
            includes you not having that character to be your most favorite.

            Why use this ranker if it is inaccurate and what makes this ranker
            any different from other rankers and tier lists?
