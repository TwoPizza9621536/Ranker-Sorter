      <h2>Why Not Rank Characters Using ELO</h2>
      <p>
        This is yet another ranker that I created using the Elo Rating System, famous in the world of chess to rate the
        skills of players as a zero-sum game. But this rating system has also been used in other applications like

          dating apps and love<span class="visually-hidden">(opens in a new tab)</span></a>.
        If love is a zero-sum game than why not the interest or attention of a character or thing that are comparable
        (or anything that is zero-sum game).
      </p>
      <p>
        To assume that the interest of a character is a zero-sum game, we need to measure interest based on how much
        attention they get, and that attention is limited. Which means attention for a character is neither gain nor
        removed, but only taken away or from other characters to have an interest for that character. In other words
        when a person shows an interest for new character, their interest is lessen for a preexisting established
        character.

          <summary>What is the Elo Rating System?</summary>
          <p>
            The Elo rating system is a method for calculating the relative skill levels of players in zero-sum games
            such as chess. It is named after its creator Arpad Elo, a Hungarian-American physics professor.

          <summary>Are the results accurate and should I take those results seriously?</summary>
          <p>
            Slightly yes with a grain of salt. Elo is mainly based on statistics and probability. A rating is just a
            number just label the probability of liking a character. Probability is just a number that tells how likely
            a character is being your most favorite which includes you not having that character to be your most
            favorite. Also the previous choices affects future ratings.

            Why use this ranker if it is inaccurate and what makes this ranker any different from other rankers and tier
            lists?
          </summary>
          <p>
            This is just a fun <del>and painful</del> project that I wanted to do, and this ranker is like any other
            rankers through ranking each characters into tiers and then rank their positions within those tiers. This
            ranker uses direct comparison to rank their entire positions.
